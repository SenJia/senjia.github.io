        This is Sen Jia, I am an AI research scientist at the Toronto AI Lab, LG Electronics. 
        I was a postdoctoral fellow at the VIP lab, waterloo university from Oct/2020 to Jun/2021. 
        I worked at the Ryerson Vision Lab advised by Prof. Neil Bruce from 2018 to 2020. 
        Prior to this, I worked at the Bristol University as a research associate in data science and my research was about exploring weakly supervised data from the web for computer vision tasks. 
        I received my phd degree from the same university under the supervision of prof. nello cristianini. 
        My research interests cover machine learning and computer vision.
